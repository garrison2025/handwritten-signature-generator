        <p>
            Welcome to <strong>HandwrittenSignatureGenerator.org</strong>. In a digital landscape increasingly dominated by generic automation and AI-generated content, we stand for the preservation of personal identity and the human touch.
        </p>

        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>
            Our mission is simple: to provide professionals, creatives, and individuals with a tool to create professional digital signatures without compromising their privacy. We believe that your signature is a unique identifier—an artifact of your personality—and it should not be stored on a remote server or processed by opaque algorithms.
        </p>

        <h3>Why We Are Different</h3>
        <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 not-prose my-10">
            <div className="p-6 bg-slate-50 rounded-xl">

                <p className="text-sm text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
                    We built SignCraft with a "Client-Side First" architecture. Your keystrokes and drawings never leave your browser.

                    Unlike basic tools that output blurry images, we rely on advanced SVG vector paths for crisp scaling.

        <h3>The Technology</h3>
        <p>
            HandwrittenSignatureGenerator.org utilizes advanced HTML5 Canvas APIs and simulated pressure-sensitivity algorithms. By calculating the velocity of your cursor, we mimic the flow of ink—thickening when you slow down and thinning when you speed up—creating a result that feels indistinguishable from a handwritten signature.

        <p>
            Your privacy is critically important to us. At <strong>HandwrittenSignatureGenerator.org</strong> ("we", "us", or "our"), we have a few fundamental principles: we don't ask you for personal information, we don't store your data on our servers, and we don't share your information with anyone.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Information Collection</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>We do not collect any personal data.</strong> The text you type, the signatures you draw, and the settings you choose are processed entirely within your web browser (Client-Side Processing). This data is stored temporarily in your browser's local storage (`localStorage`) solely for your convenience, so you don't lose your work if you refresh the generator page. This data is never transmitted to our servers.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Analytics and Cookies</h3>
        <p>
            We may use anonymous, privacy-focused analytics to understand how our site is used (e.g., total visitor counts). These tools do not track your browsing history across other websites and do not collect personally identifiable information (PII). We do not use advertising cookies.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Data Security</h3>
        <div className="flex items-start gap-4 bg-green-50 p-4 rounded-lg border border-green-100 not-prose my-6">
            <Lock className="w-6 h-6 text-green-700 flex-shrink-0 mt-1" />
            <div>
                <h4 className="font-bold text-green-800 text-sm">End-to-End Client Security</h4>
                <p className="text-green-700 text-sm mt-1">
                    Since no signature data is ever uploaded to the cloud, there is zero risk of your signature being intercepted or leaked from a database breach on our end.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>4. Third-Party Links</h3>
        <p>
            Our website may contain links to third-party sites (e.g., social media). We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those sites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of any third-party sites you visit.

    >
        <p>
            Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") carefully before using the <strong>handwrittensignaturegenerator.org</strong> website operated by us.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
        <p>
            By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the Service.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Intellectual Property of Generated Signatures</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>You own your signature.</strong> We claim no intellectual property rights over the signatures, graphics, or text you generate using our tool. You are free to use the downloaded PNG or SVG files for personal, commercial, legal, or creative purposes without attribution.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Legal Validity and E-Signatures</h3>
        <p>
            This tool generates graphical representations of a signature. The legal validity of an electronic signature is defined by laws such as the <strong><a href="https://www.fdic.gov/resources/supervision-and-examinations/consumer-compliance-examination-manual/documents/10/x-3-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ESIGN Act</a></strong> (U.S.) and <strong><a href="https://www.uniformlaws.org/committees/community-home?CommunityKey=2c04b76c-2b7d-4399-977e-d5876ba7e034" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">UETA</a></strong>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            While our signature creator creates the visual component often used in e-signing workflows, the legal binding nature of a signature typically requires additional audit trails, consent, and intent validation which are outside the scope of this image generation tool. We recommend using this tool in conjunction with certified e-signature platforms for high-stakes contracts.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>
            The materials on handwrittenSignatureGenerator.org's website are provided on an 'as is' basis.

        </p>

        <h3>5. Limitations</h3>
        <p>
            In no event shall handwrittenSignatureGenerator.org or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on our website.
        </p>
